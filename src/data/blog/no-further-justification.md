# Why Write?

I've always hated writing, and for many years I struggled to understand why.
Its not physically strenuous, its not boring, but sitting down to write is one of the most laborious activities I've ever done.
Recently I've had this realization: I hate writing because I'm very conscious of how I'm perceived.
I avoid writing because I don't know how my thoughts will be perceived or judged.

That said, I've reached a point in my life where I have no more energy to care. I have ideas that I think are worth expressing, so I'm going to write. Welcome to that journey.
